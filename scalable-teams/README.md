### Settings

Name | Default | Description
---- | ------- | -----------
`type` | `stable` | The method in which the script obtains the files.
`teams` | `4` | The amount of teams to create.

#### type
There are three possible values for the `type` setting. Setting the value to `custom` assumes you have a `player.json` file already created, allowing for graceful merging. Setting the value to `stable` downloads the vanilla `player.json` file for the latest stable release, and setting the value to `beta` downloads the vanilla `player.json` file for the latest beta release.
